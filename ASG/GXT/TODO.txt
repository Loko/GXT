gxtPlayerIndexEqualityComparer to a real singleton?
collision response after tuning epa
fixed rotation boolean in rigid body class
MoI for polygon

Questions for Egert
	- Resources for collision response
	- Material binded to rigid body or geom
	- How should Triggers be handled?
		- Geom class could handle it now, just may not be clear (disable response, bind events to trigger)
	- Make a shape class?
		- Support for more than just polygons?  Only really beneficial for circles, boxes are just 4 vertices
	- Raycast in a sweep and prune
	- Joints/Constraints?
